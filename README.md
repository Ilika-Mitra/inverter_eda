# inverter_eda
## prelayout simulations
###1. transient analysis
have done the transient analysis of the inverter in the folder of /inverter/xschem

###
though there are other prelayout simulation ssuch as the timing and dc analysis, power analysi of a simple inverter which you can find in the github repo by [Mayank Gupta]([url](https://github.com/D-curs-D/Inverter-design-and-analysis-using-sky130pdk/tree/main)https://github.com/D-curs-D/Inverter-design-and-analysis-using-sky130pdk/tree/main)

##2. layout
we ahve designed the layout using sky130 pdk on magic vlsi tool

##3.post layout simulations
have the post layout simulations of the inverter in the folder of /inverter/postlayout/
